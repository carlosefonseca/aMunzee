# aMunzee #

This is a user-script to fix some problems with the Munzee.com site. It's a work in progress but helps ease the pain of using the site.

Feel free to comment and add stuff.

## Current features ##

* The Munzee info (munzee.com/m/user/#) is much better now, with clear text and divided contents.
* The map in the Munzee info page occupies the whole width of the content
* The Map in munzee.com/map is totally fullscreen
* The "Welcome back *user-name*" at the top of the page links the the public user page where the Captured Munzees are displayed


## Install ##

If you're on Chrome or other GreaseMonkey-supported browser, [click here](https://github.com/carlosefonseca/aMunzee/raw/master/amunzee.user.js) to install.


Another options is to manually open the linked file whith Google Chrome, or other browser that has GreaseMonkey and enjoy.




## Some ideas I have for later ##

* Make the Map start at a position defined by the URL
* Use a different color for the Munzees already found on the map
* Avoid downloading all 10K munzees to see the map
