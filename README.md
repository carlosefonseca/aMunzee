# aMunzee #

This is a user-script to fix some problems with the Munzee.com site. It's a work in progress but helps ease the pain of using the site.

Current features:

* The Munzee info (munzee.com/m/user/#) is much better now, with clear text and divided contents.
* The map in the Munzee info page occupies the whole width of the content
* The Map in munzee.com/map is totally fullscreen
* The "Welcome back *user-name*" at the top of the page links the the public user page where the Captured Munzees are displayed


## Install ##

Open the .user.js file in Google Chrome, or other browser that has GreaseMonkey and enjoy.




Some ideas I have:

* Make the Map start at a position defined by the URL
* Use a different color for the Munzees already found on the map
* Avoid downloading all 10K munzees to see the map
